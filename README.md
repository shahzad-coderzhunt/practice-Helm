## Helm Practice: From Basics to Advanced

This repository contains my hands-on Helm practice. I'm learning step by step—from basics to advanced—using an AI‑assisted roadmap. I keep my exercises, notes, and charts here as I go.

### Goals
- Understand Helm concepts (charts, releases, templates, values)
- Author high-quality charts with proper structure and helpers
- Manage dependencies, environments, and upgrades safely
- Validate, test, lint, and package charts
- Automate with CI/CD, work with OCI registries, and sign artifacts

---

## Prerequisites
- Minikube installed and configured for both Windows and WSL
- Helm v3.18.3 installed
- Docker, Git, Python, Node.js (for local tooling)
